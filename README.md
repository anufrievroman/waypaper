## Installation

Install at least one of the backends and Waypaper, which works as a frontend.

### 1. Install a backend

Install a preferred backend from your package manager: [swww](https://github.com/Horus645/swww) or [swaybg](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg) or [hyprpaper](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper) on Wayland or [xwallpaper](https://github.com/stoeckmann/xwallpaper) or [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh) on Xorg or [mpvpaper](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper) or [wallutils](https://github.com/xyproto/wallutils) on both.

### 2. Install Waypaper

Install `waypaper`, which is available in different repositories:

#### On all distributions

`pipx install waypaper`

If `pipx` is not found, you first need to install `pipx` from your package manager, it's sometimes called `python-pipx`.

#### On Arch-based distributions

`yay -S waypaper`

The [waypaper](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/waypaper) package and unstable developer package [waypaper-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/waypaper-git) are available in AUR, thanks to *metak*. Please upvote to support the project.

#### On NixOS

The `waypaper` package is available thanks to Basil Keeler.

#### On OpenSUSE

Users of OpenSUSE [reported issue with installation](https://github.com/anufrievroman/waypaper/issues/30) via `pipx install waypaper`. This can be resolved by installing the `python313-pycairo-devel` and `python313-gobject-devel` packages first.

#### On Fedora

Waypaper is available in an external repository owned by Solopasha. You can add this repository as `sudo dnf copr enable solopasha/hyprland` and install as `sudo dnf install waypaper`.

### Dependencies

- `swww` or `swaybg` or `xwallpaper` or `feh` or `wallutils` or `hyprpaper` or `mpvpaper`

## Contribution

Feel free to propose PR and suggest the improvements. I'll appreciate help with packaging for various distributions. If you wish to contribute with translation into your language, please see the `translations.py` file. Here are a few guiding principles for contribution:

- Please do not apply automatic code formatting tools on the entire code base.
- Please propose features separately, don't combine unrelated changes into one PR.
- For big changes, please open an issue first to discuss, otherwise PR might be declined.
- If the changes involve hundreds of lines of code, probably something is wrong. Most things can be done with small adjustments.
