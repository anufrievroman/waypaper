## Contribution

Feel free to propose PR and suggest the improvements. I'll highly appreciate help with packaging for various distributions. If you wish to contribute with translation into your language, please see the `translations.py` file. Here a few guiding principles for creating pull requests:

- Please do not apply automatic code formatting tools on the entire code base.
- Please do separate pull requests for each feature, don't combine unrelated changes into one PR.
- For big changes, please open an issue first to discuss, otherwise PR might be declined.
